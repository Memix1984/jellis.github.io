<p>Welcome to this page, this is my test page to learn on working on webpages in my Web Development class. My hobbies include hardware, software, and messing with vidya. Here is an image or gif, I haven't yet decided on what precisely it is so it will be a surprise.</p>
  <!--This part shows the image after the paragraph, and has 'alt' in case the image fails to load. There is also width and height labels in pixels, but percentage can be used for browser specific spacing. -->
  <img src="Images/Cat looking.jpg" width="350px" height="350px" alt="This should be a cat looking towards the side, if it loaded improperly as signified by the alt sign in this image component"/>
  <!--"Ul" Means, "unordered list" and can be utilized to add bulletpoints to your website.-->
  <ul>
  <!-- "Li" stands for Listed Item, and can be used in a list, numbered or bulleted. Also, This "a" is an anchor. You can use these to add things (I.e. Images, more text, linked text/images) within the same line list or whatever.-->
    <li>Can you name a better looking cat? <a>Yeah probably not.</a></li>
